SML Testing
===========

Simple framework for testing SML code. 
Provides some `assert_*` functions, and the ability to only output feedback from those tests that fail, if any. 
See the [`fizzbuzz_tests.sml` file](https://github.com/kvalle/sml-testing/blob/master/fizzbuzz_tests.sml) for simple example usage.
